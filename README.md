# wealth-inequality-simulation
For my creative final project, I developed an interactive simulation to explore the issue of wealth inequality using mathematical tools from counting and number theory. My project models how a fixed amount of wealth can be distributed among a group of individuals and how different taxation/redistribution systems impact economic outcomes over time.
